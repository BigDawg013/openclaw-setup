# Deep Research Pro

Multi-source research with structured output and citations.

## Workflow

1. **Define scope** — What question needs answering? What depth?
2. **Gather sources** — Search web, read pages, collect data
3. **Cross-reference** — Verify claims across multiple sources
4. **Synthesize** — Structure findings as a clear report
5. **Cite** — Every claim backed by a source

## Output Format

Reports should include:
- Executive summary (2-3 sentences)
- Key findings with citations
- Options with pros/cons (when applicable)
- Confidence level for each finding
- Source list
