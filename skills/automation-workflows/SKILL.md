# Automation Workflows

Identify and implement automation workflows for repetitive tasks.

## Workflow

1. **Identify** — Find tasks done more than twice a week that don't require creative thinking
2. **Choose tools** — Zapier, Make, n8n, or custom scripts
3. **Design** — Map triggers, actions, and conditions
4. **Build & test** — Implement and validate the workflow
5. **Monitor** — Track performance and optimize over time

## Use Cases

- Lead capture and CRM routing
- Content distribution across platforms
- Customer health monitoring
- Invoice and payment tracking
